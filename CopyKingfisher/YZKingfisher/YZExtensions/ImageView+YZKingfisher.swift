extension KingfisherWrapper where Base: KFCrossPlatformImageView {
    
    //MARK: Setting Image
    
    /// Sets an image to the image view with a `Source`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - source: The `Source` object defines data information from network or a data provider.
    ///   - placeholder: A placeholder to show while retrieving the image from the given `resource`.
    ///   - options: An options set to define image setting behaviors. See `KingfisherOptionsInfo` for more.
    ///   - progressBlock: Called when the image downloading progress gets updated. If the response does not contain an
    ///                    `expectedContentLength`, this block will not be called.
    ///   - completionHandler: Called when the image retrieved and set finished.
    /// - Returns: A task represents the image downloading.
    ///
    /// - Note:
    /// This is the easiest way to use Kingfisher to boost the image setting process from a source. Since all parameters
    /// have a default value except the `source`, you can set an image from a certain URL to an image view like this:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// // Set image from a network source.
    /// let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/image.png")!
    /// imageView.kf.setImage(with: .network(url))
    ///
    /// // Or set image from a data provider.
    /// let provider = LocalFileImageDataProvider(fileURL: fileURL)
    /// imageView.kf.setImage(with: .provider(provider))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// For both `.network` and `.provider` source, there are corresponding view extension methods. So the code
    /// above is equivalent to:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// imageView.kf.setImage(with: url)
    /// imageView.kf.setImage(with: provider)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Internally, this method will use `KingfisherManager` to get the source.
    /// Since this method will perform UI changes, you must call it from the main thread.
    /// Both `progressBlock` and `completionHandler` will be also executed in the main thread.
    ///
//    @discardableResult
//    func setImage(
//        with source:
//    ) {
//
//    }
    
}
